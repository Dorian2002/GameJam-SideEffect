## Project presentation :

I developed, in a team of 7 people, a runner game in Blueprint with Unreal Engine 5.1. This project has been made during a 55 hours GameJam in my third year of graduate school.
Our game is a 3D 3rd person runner in an alien city.
The player, coming out of a party, has to go back home. He has to dodge the obstacles in his way and find the balance between water and alcohol to not fall down drunk.
