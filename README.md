## Project presentation :

I developed, in a team of 7 people, a runner game in Blueprint with Unreal Engine 5.1. This project has been made during a 55 hours GameJam in my third year of graduate school.
Our game is a 3D 3rd person runner in an alien city.
The player, coming out of a party, has to go back home with the highest score. He has to dodge the obstacles in his way and find the balance between water and alcohol to not fall down drunk. The drunker he is, the more points he scores but the faster he goes the more the camera will move.
